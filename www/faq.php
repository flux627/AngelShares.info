<h2>General Questions</h2>



<p><b>Q: What are AngelShares?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> AngelShares is an initiative by Invictus Innovations that are a way to direct resources currently wasted on mining equipment and electricity and direct them into helping the crypto-equity industry grow.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Q: How do does the daily AngelShares auction work?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Every day until July 20 2014, 10,000 AGS will be given out to donators of Bitcoin and ProtoShares- 5000 per currency. For each day, the total amount of BTC and PTS are divided by 5000, and the amount that you donated in this day period is multiplied by this number to yeild your AGS share. </p>
</br>
<p><b>Q: How are the days split up, exactly?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Every day is split between midnight-to-midnight UTC time. More precisely, the donation transactions count toward the day of the UCT timestamp of the block that the transaction is included in.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Q: How many AngelShares will there be?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> 10,000 AGS * 200 days = 2,000,000</p>

<p><b>Q: What happens when I send a donation?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Donations are logged in the public block chain to be referenced every time a new DAC is released. This website keeps track of the donations to both Bitcoin and ProtoShare blockchains, and provides the information in an easy-to-access format.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Q: Are AngelShares transferrable?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b>No. Since each balance is tied to a wallet address, there is no way to transfer a wallet without having trust that the other party hasn't copied the private keys.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Q: Can I donate from a multi-address PTS/BTC wallet?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes. When the time comes to claim your distribution share, there will be tools to import your wallet.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Q: Can I send donations from an exchange?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No, you have to have control over your private keys for the addresses you donate from. It is best to send your ProtoShares and Bitcoin from an encrypted wallet located on your computer.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Q: Will AGS be sent to me?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No. The proof that exists of the transactions to the Angel Addresses in the ProtoShare and Bitcoin blockchains are used to determine DAC distribution shares. You own your AngelShares as much as you own the private keys in your wallets.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Q: What will the funds for AngelShares be used for?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> 100% of the funds will be used to fund production of new DACs. 0% is kept as profits from Invictus Innovations.</p>
